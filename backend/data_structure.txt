On harddrive: JSON. 

a node is: [content, next, prev]
(so that node[-1] gives you prev. Why use list? It is best to pickle builtins to avoid unpickle failure. Also, object namespace is hashmap to begin with.)

[
	{	# named tuple
		token: 'q4fq8p7f298'
		time: 394827
		payload: {
			amount: 3
			currency_type: dollar
			tags: [
				...
			]
			comment: chicken sandwich
		}
	}, 
	{
		token, 
		time, 
		payload: {
			tag_name, 
			tag_explanation, 
		}	
	},
	...
]

To Python, payload is just a JSON string. 
JS can have whatever in the payload. 
Note: payload is not an object, but a JSON. So Each entry is a nested JSON.
